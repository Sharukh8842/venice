    <h1>The City of Venice</h1>

    <p>Venice, known as the "Floating City," is one of the most unique cities in the world. Built on a network of canals, it is renowned for its romantic gondola rides, stunning architecture, and rich history. The city consists of over 100 small islands connected by bridges and separated by canals.</p>

    <p>One of the most iconic landmarks in Venice is St. Mark's Basilica, a magnificent example of Italo-Byzantine architecture. Nearby, the Piazza San Marco offers breathtaking views and is a hub of activity for both locals and tourists. Venice is also famous for its annual Carnival, where participants don elaborate masks and costumes.</p>

    <p>Another highlight of Venice is the Grand Canal, the main waterway that runs through the city. Lined with historic buildings, this canal is best explored by vaporetto or water taxi. Visitors to Venice can also enjoy traditional Venetian cuisine, including dishes like risotto al nero di seppia (squid ink risotto) and sarde in saor (sweet and sour sardines).</p>
